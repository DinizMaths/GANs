# GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)

## What are GANs?

GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) were introduced in 2014 by Ian Goodfellow and other researchers from the University of Montreal. They are a set of generative models capable of creating original content across various domains, such as images, music, speech, and writing. The architecture of GANs consists of two main neural networks:

- Generator
- Discriminator

These networks are placed in opposition to each other, resulting in the name "adversarial".
